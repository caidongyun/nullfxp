 In the list of features (http://curl.haxx.se/docs/features.html), one can read : 
      FTPS (*1) 
     - explicit ftps:// support that use SSL on both connections 
    - implicit "AUTH TSL" and "AUTH SSL" usage to "upgrade" plain ftp:// 
      connection to use SSL for both or one of the connections 
Are you sure you use the correct terms ? 
  
 From http://www.ford-hutchinson.com/~fh-1-pfh/ftps-ext.html : 
  - the SSL connect mode (with port 990) is implicit 
  - the AUTH SSL using normally port 21 is implicit 
  - the AUTH TLS using normally port 21 is not implicit 
  - The prefered mode is AUTH TLS which is NOT implicit
